# Description

**A** simple website for To do list in React. Made for practicing skills. <br/>
**Used** bootstrapIcons CDN in this project. <br/><br/>

## What I used to optimize the code and user experience
**For** more optimized code I used hooks, useEffect, useState, as well as the “function dileging” technique, for more optimal code writing.<br/>
**Also** for the user's convenience, all his changes will be recorded and loaded from localStorage. <br/><br/>

## Styling
**Component** animations are written using CSS to save time, and design is not the main thing in this mini-project.<br/> **Here** I wanted to show and try more seriously react hooks, and just learn to write the logic of the site better<br/><br/>

## Conclusions for me
**Here** I wanted to show and try more seriously react hooks, and just to learn how to write better site logic.<br/> **Also** to work a bit with json, namely writing and reading possible user data on the site.<br/><br/>
