# Description

**Simple** site for creating a to-do list in React. Designed for practicing skills. <br/>
**This** project used CDN bootstrapIcons. As well as Chart.JS for React <br/><br/>

## What I used to optimize the code and user experience
**For** more optimized code, I used hooks, useEffect, useState, and the “function scattering” technique to write code more optimally.<br/>
**Also** for the user's convenience, all their changes will be recorded and loaded from localStorage. <br/><br/>

## Styling
**Component** animations are written using CSS to save time, and design is not the main thing in this mini-project.<br/> **Here** I wanted to show and try more seriously react hooks, a couple of libraries new to me.<br/><br/>
